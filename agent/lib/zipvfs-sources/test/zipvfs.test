# Organization of tests:
#
#   zipvfs1.test:   Simple, warm-body tests.
#
#   zipvfs2.test:   Locking and hot-journal rollback tests. 
# 
#   zipvfs3.test:   Fault-injection tests.
#
#   zipvfs5.test:   Miscellaneous tests, including tests of corrupt files.
#
#   zipvfs6.test:   Tests of the ZIPVFS_CTRL_COMPACT file-control.
#
#   zipvfs7.test:   Tests that focus on the code that manipulates the 
#                   free-slot b-tree stored in the zipvfs file.
#
#   zipvfs8.test:   Test that the 52 byte block starting at offset 40 of the
#                   user database file is replicated at the same location
#                   of the zipvfs database file.
#
#   zipvfsG.test:   Tests for zipvfs databases that use WAL mode.
#
#   zipvfsG.test:   Test that using "PRAGMA journal_mode=OFF" during a
#                   VACUUM does not leave the database vulnerable to
#                   corruption, even if an error occurs and the VACUUM is
#                   rolled back.
