ZIPVFS:<br>
An SQLite Extension For Compressed Read/Write Databases
</h1>

This website ([http://www.sqlite.org/zipvfs]) is where all of the source code
for the [http://www.sqlite.org/ | SQLite] Compressed Read/Write Database
(ZIPVFS) extension is stored and archived.  If you are
an ZIPVFS licensee, this is where you come to view and/or download the latest
ZIPVFS source code.

<b>Note to ZIPVFS licensees:</b>
This is a live software configuration management system.  What you
see here is exactly what the developers see.  There are no secrets. 
Every effort is made to ensure that check-ins on the "trunk" are stable
and ready to use.  However, it is possible that errors can slip into the
trunk branch.  Just because code appears on the trunk does not 
necessarily mean that it works.  Consult the SQLite.org staff for 
further information.
