How To Compile And Use ZIPVFS with System.Data.SQLite
</h1>

<h2>1.0 Introduction</h2>

This document explains how to compile an extended version of System.Data.SQLite
that is able to read and write compressed database files using ZIPVFS.

<h2>2.0 Obtaining and Compiling zlib</h2>

This is now done automatically by the build tool.

<h2>3.0 Compiling System.Data.SQLite with ZIPVFS support for Win32</h2>

This section assumes that the System.Data.SQLite source code is present in
a directory named "dotnet" that is a peer of the root ZIPVFS source code
directory.

To build System.Data.SQLite with ZIPVFS, the following commands can be used
from a command prompt from within the root ZIPVFS source code directory:

<blockquote><pre>
..\dotnet\Externals\Eagle\bin\netFramework40\EagleShell.exe -file src\buildSds.eagle "" "" "" MSIL
..\dotnet\Externals\Eagle\bin\netFramework40\EagleShell.exe -file src\buildSds.eagle "" "" "" Win32
..\dotnet\Externals\Eagle\bin\netFramework40\EagleShell.exe -file src\buildSds.eagle "" "" "" x64
</pre></blockquote>

<h2>4.0 Verifying System.Data.SQLite with ZIPVFS support</h2>

The following command can be used to verify the System.Data.SQLite binaries
were built correctly:

<blockquote><pre>
..\dotnet\Externals\Eagle\bin\netFramework40\EagleShell.exe -file src\testSds.eagle
</pre></blockquote>

<h2>5.0 Using System.Data.SQLite with ZIPVFS support</h2>

Opening a ZIPVFS database with System.Data.SQLite requires using a connection
string similar to one of the following:

<blockquote><pre>
"Data Source=database.db;VfsName=zlib;ZipVfsVersion=v2;"
</pre></blockquote>

<blockquote><pre>
"FullUri=file:database.db?vfs=zipvfs&zv=zlib;ZipVfsVersion=v3;"
</pre></blockquote>
